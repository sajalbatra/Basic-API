## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
3. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally on the default port (27017).

## Usage

1. Start the Express server by running:
The server will run on port 3000 by default. You can change the port in the `app.listen` call in `index.js`.

2. API Endpoints:

- `POST /adduser`: Create a new user.
- `GET /user`: Get user data based on provided parameters.
- `PATCH /update`: Update user data based on provided parameters.
- `DELETE /delete`: Delete user data based on provided parameters.

3. Make API requests using your preferred API testing tool or client application.

## Route Handlers

The application includes the following route handlers for CRUD operations:

- `createuserdata`: Create a new user.
- `getuserdata`: Get user data based on provided parameters.
- `updateuserdata`: Update user data based on provided parameters.
- `deleteuserdata`: Delete user data based on provided parameters.

## MongoDB Connection

The application connects to a MongoDB database named "6pp" using Mongoose. Connection settings can be configured in the `mongoose.connect` call in `index.js`.

## Error Handling

Basic error handling is included for database operations. However, consider enhancing error handling and validation according to your application's requirements.

## Security

This is a basic template. For production use, you should implement proper security measures, including input validation, authentication, and authorization.
